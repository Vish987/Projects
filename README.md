# Projects
Welcome to my personal repository of Computer Science projects! This collection showcases various projects listed on my resume.

## Projects List
### 1. Game of Nim

**Description:**

• Created an AI that autonomously learned to excel at NIM by utilizing Q-learning calculations and reinforcement learning methods to consistently outperform opponents after approximately 7,500 rounds of self-play

• Standardized Q-learning by balancing reward estimation and epsilon-greedy exploration to ensure effective learning, displaying expertise in AI model creation, algorithmic analysis, and object-oriented programming

**Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy

### 2. Handwritten Digit Recognition

**Description:**

• Developed a robust handwritten digit recognition model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with pooling and flattening techniques to achieve an estimated 98% accuracy on the MNIST dataset with over 60,000 digits

• Optimized the CNN model by training on an additional 10,000+ digits, exhibiting proficiency in computer vision, deep learning, and neural network architectures for image classification

**Technologies Used:** Python, NumPy, Keras, TensorFlow, Pygame

### 3. Undergraduate Research

**Description:**

• Redesigning a program to increase seismic fault sensitivity screening by calculating principal stresses, plotting Mohr’s circles, and performing Monte Carlo simulations, facilitating probabilistic seismic hazard analysis

• Integrating vectorized calculations using efficient mathematical operations and list comprehension, reducing computation time by around 80% to enable faster and more accurate seismic fault sensitivity assessments

• Executing Monte Carlo simulations for modeling uncertainties in input parameters by generating 1,000 simulations to examine pore pressure failure scenarios and visualize results through detailed histograms

**Technologies Used:** MATLAB, Python, Matplotlib, NumPy, Pandas
